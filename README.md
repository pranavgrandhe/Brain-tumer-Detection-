# Brain-tumer-Detection-
 Implemented a hybrid CNN + Transformer  model for brain tumor classification, achieving 99.47% accuracy on MRI scans. Integrated interpretability techniques like  Grad-CAM and saliency maps to visualize model predictions. Deployed the solution with a Gradio web interface for  realtime tumor detection and explanation.
